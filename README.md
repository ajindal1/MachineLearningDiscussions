# MachineLearningDiscussions

These notebooks are part of CS 178 (Data Mining & Machine Learning) course at UC Irvine, where I took discussion hour sessions for undegraduate students. The notebooks covers various topics in Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning.

The notebooks are mostly inspired from the work of Prof. Sameer Singh.
